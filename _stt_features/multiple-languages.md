<p>
	In the first version of the app we provided voice recordings, however these were only available in English.
</p>
<p>
	Although it would be possible to provide voice recordings in other languages, this would have greatly increased the development time and as a result made the inclusion of some languages problematic.
</p>
<p>
	Care has been taken to ensure that the translations are of a high quality and that numbering and wording is used correctly for that culture.
