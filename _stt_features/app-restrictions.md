In Speaking Times Tables you can access settings from within the app. This makes it easier for parents and teachers to make changes quickly, perhaps in a classroom environment.
However if you’re a teacher or have several children, you’ll want to spend some time setting up the app for your students. So you’ll probably wish to prevent unwanted changes.

The app provides features that make it easy to secure these settings. Once enabled, you can make quick changes for your students.

Several features have been added to the app, however depending on your devices these settings will be slightly different. For example, older devices will only have access to the pin screen rather than Touch ID / Face ID.

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6">

{% responsive_image path: static/stt_features/ipad-login.png title: "Lorem ipsum..." width: 300 %}

	</div>
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6">

{% responsive_image path: assets/test-page-image-1.jpg alt: "Lorem ipsum..." %}


	</div>
</div>

If your devices support Touch ID / Face ID, you have the option to use these or the pin. Where there are several teachers, the pin feature may be more convenient.
