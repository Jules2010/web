			The Sad Face Chart app, was initially written in 2011, over the course of a few days.
		</div>

		<div class="pb-20">
			Admittedly it's a very basic app. The reason I developed it was that I wanted to have a sad face chart while we were out of the house to help with my child's behaviour.
		</div>

		<div class="pb-20">
			More recently, five years after the initial development, I updated the app making it work on more devices including iPads.
		</div>

		<div class="pb-20">
			The idea behind a sad face chart is keep track of when your child is naughty. You add a sad face sticker to the chart, filling up the slots on the chart. The child then has to perform good tasks to get the sad faces removed. There's also the happy face chart or a combination of sad / happy smilies. Schools often have this type of chart in the classrooms.
		</div>

		<div class="pb-20">
			After evaluating feedback the app was renamed and called Happy + Sad Face Chart. Also another commonly requested feature, was to provide support for multiple children.
		</div>

		<div class="pb-20">
			This also led to iCloud syncing being added. The app has become a test bed for this functionality previously added to Speaking Times Tables. However the functionality has gone further and been moved into a framework which hopefully can be used within other apps in the future.
