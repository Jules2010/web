Speaking Times Table for iPhone was my first iPhone app developed in 2010. Please don't confuse this with Speaking Times Tables for iOS written in 2015.

Previously I had developed speaking times table software for PC CD-ROM which I sold on eBay. Back then the speech technology wasn't that good.

But over the life of the software I sold 3000 copies. It proved very popular so it seemed a natural progression to move the idea to iPhone.

My wife and I recorded our voices for the sums. I chopped the numbers and symbols into sound files and played these in the app together.

At the time that was this was a much better solution and using the speech technology provided by iOS.

Design of the app was aimed at kids and I used you cute chimp images to make the app look fun.

I decided to move on to other projects, several years later I decided to update the app and make big improvements. I produce some good prototype videos and came to the conclusion that the app would need to completely rewritten. This idea developed into a brand-new app due to the effort involved. Speaking Times Tables for iOS was born in 2015.
