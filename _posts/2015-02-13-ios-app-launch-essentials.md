Even if you're releasing the most unsociable app or a kids app (where you can't have any links) always, always setup a Facebook and Twitter account.

Always use a tracking service to tell you what's worked and what hasn't.

Always add mailchimp sign up forms where ever you can, adding a checkbox to your contact form is good too, yes you can do this with Wordpress.

I realize this quite a short post, but I think it deserves it's own post.
