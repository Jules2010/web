Here's a a list of my favourite chrome extensions, I'll probably add to this in the future.

### [User Javascript and CSS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld)
This is a extension which allows you to add css and Javascript to any site. You can also save your changes within the extension. Granted this doesn't support sass, but it's pretty neat to make quick changes, perhaps just to play around until before committing the changes to an actual projects.
